# OceanOS

OceanOS is a Personal Operating System.

You can see it as a mix of productivity app, note taking, expense tracker and much more...
It uses the concept of [lifestreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestreaming) to organize your life.

It is a great tool for habit formation, tracking objectives, and stay organized.
